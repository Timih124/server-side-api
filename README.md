# Weather Dashboard API

## Built a weatherdashboard with an open API   
When a user inputs a city and clicks search a forecast for that day appears.  A five day forecast should appear, but I'm having difficulties getting that on to the page. Going to work with my tutor to update.


Was able to get today's data on the page, but wasn't able to loop in the array. Tried different methods, and left it on the HTML with the plan to finish.

Going to do a fully updated read me. Once that is complete.
